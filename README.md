# Jimbo-HW-3-Password-Generator

--- This project was all about creating a random password generator. Not going to 
lie, it was very challenging. Almost had it but had to submit. 
I plan on resubmitting my finished work. Other than that it enabled us to use
a lot of the code we've learned as of recent. ---

script.js - 
---------
* Declared variables for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and and special characters.
* Commented things I understood. Commented OUT things that I couldn't get to work
* Called a function which allowed for the generation of random characters.
